* Differences Between Node.js and Browsers

- Both the browser and node.js uses JavaScript as their programming language. Building apps that run in the browser is completely different from building a Node.js application. Despite the fact that it's always javascript there are some differences that make experience radically different.

1. Browser Side 
- Browser side most of the time we are interacting with the Document or Window's API's like cookies.
1. Nodejs Side
- Node js side there is no API's like Document and Window's and all the other objects that are provided by the browser.
- And in the browser, we don't have all the nice APIs that Node.js provides through its modules, like the filesystem access functionality.

2. Browser Side 
- In Browser side you don't get the luxury to choose that what browser your user's will use, this is very convenient.

2. Nodejs Side
- In nodejs you can control the environment Unless you are building the open source application that anyone can deploy.
- This means that you can write all the ES2015 + Javascript that your nodejs version can support.

3. Browser Side 
- In browser side since nodejs v12 we can only use the ES-Module system to import.

3. Nodejs Side.
- In nodejs we can use both the commonjs and ES-Module system both it means required() and import both can work.

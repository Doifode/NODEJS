Node.js File Paths
Every file in the system has a path. On Linux and macOS, a path might look like: /users/joe/file.txt while Windows computers are different, and have a structure such as: C:\users\joe\file.txt

You need to pay attention when using paths in your applications, as this difference must be taken into account.

You include this module in your files using const path = require('node:path'); and you can start using its methods.

Getting information out of a path
Given a path, you can extract information out of it using those methods:

dirname: gets the parent folder of a file
basename: gets the filename part
extname: gets the file extension

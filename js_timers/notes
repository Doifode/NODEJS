TIMERS 

setTimeout()
When writing JavaScript code, you might want to delay the execution of a function.

This is the job of setTimeout. You specify a callback function to execute later, and a value expressing how later you want it to run, in milliseconds:

setTimeout(() => {
  // runs after 2 seconds
}, 2000);
setTimeout(() => {
  // runs after 50 milliseconds
}, 50);


setTimeout returns the timer id. This is generally not used, but you can store this id, and clear it if you want to delete this scheduled function execution:
const id = setTimeout(() => {
  // should run after 2 seconds
}, 2000);

// I changed my mind
clearTimeout(id);

Introduction to NODE JS 
- Node js is an open source and cross-platform Javascript Runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project.
- Node js runs the V8 JS engine, The core of google chrome, Outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be a performant.
- A Node.js app runs on the single thread without creating a new thread for every request.
- Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevents Node.js code from blocking and generally. The libraries in node.js are written in the non-blocking code paradigms. making blocking behavior exception rather than the norm.
- When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.
- This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.
- Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.

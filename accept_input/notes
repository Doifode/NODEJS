Accept input from the command line in Node.js
How to make a Node.js CLI program interactive?

Node.js since version 7 provides the readline module to perform exactly this: get input from a readable stream such as the process.stdin stream, which during the execution of a Node.js program is the terminal input, one line at a time

const readline = require('node:readline');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});

rl.question(`What's your name?`, name => {
  console.log(`Hi ${name}!`);
  rl.close();
});
